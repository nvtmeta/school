                        Whats is HTML?
                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
                        content.
                        For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points,
                        or
                        using images and data
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col1 col-4 ">
                    <p>
                        What is meant by CSS?
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                        document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
                        describes
                        how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                        technologies
                        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
                        client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
